Hello there!

This is an interactive tutorial that guides you through basic Linux and common admistration tasks associated with the Linux system.

**Beware:** For the sake of simplicity some things such as the package manager **apt** will be specific to the Debian/Ubuntu distro, the rest of the tutorial is agnostic of a certain distribution.

We will be going through the how to, for the following topics:

  - debug network connectivity issues
  - look for files on the filesystem and where to look for logs
  - check proccesses, disk usage, and memory usage
  - when and how to use common Linux commands

Let's get started!
